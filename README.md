# Ping Pong Tournament Generator Project

Technical challenge set at the end of the DevelopMe Coding Fellowship.

## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

Its up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
* ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
* continued rounds until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other)

## To run this projecton your local machine

You will need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed.

On the command line run 

```git clone git@github.com:j-meech/Ping-pong-tournament-app.git
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Technologies

I chose to use React to create the generator as a web app and Redux and Immutable to store the data.
I styled the app with Sass and compiled it to css via a script in the package.json file and running `yarn run saas` to watch my files.
I version managed the project with git.
